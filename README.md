# React + Vite

This is an individual school project where i created a foodapplication. Users can search for food dishes and access recipes with ingredient lists and instructions.
The application is built with React.js and utilizes MealDB's open API. 
I have designed the application's interface myself by starting the designwork in figma and then using CSS style-sheets.
